### Task 6.4: Test Coverage Comparison and Success Metrics
- Measure final test coverage after all tasks are complete

  3. Final coverage after refactoring (current)
- Calculate total lines of code:
  1. Count lines in mock implementations before the project
  2. Count lines in mock implementations after the project
- Evaluate against success criteria:
  1. Test coverage must increase compared to baseline
  2. Net negative in total lines of code (due to centralized mocks)
  3. Reduced duplication of mock code
  4. Increased API contract test coverage
- Create a final report with graphs and metrics
- **Expected effort**: ~50 lines of documentation
- **Commit message**: `docs: final metrics report comparing baseline, mid-project, and final test coverage`

## Implementation Order Recommendation

For the most efficient implementation, we recommend following this order:

1. Complete Task 0.1 (baseline metrics)
2. Complete all of Phase 1 (basic infrastructure)
3. Complete Task 2.1 and Task 2.2 (centralize existing mocks)
4. Complete Task 3.1 and Task 3.2 (server and client setup)
5. Implement Task 5.1 (basic test example) to validate the approach
6. Complete remaining tasks from Phase 2, 3, and 4 in parallel
7. Complete Phase 5 (examples and measurement)
8. Complete Phase 6 (refactoring and metrics)

This order ensures you can validate the approach early with a working example before implementing all the details.
