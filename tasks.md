# Integration Test Package Implementation Tasks

This document breaks down the implementation of the integration test package approach described in `testing.md` into concrete, small-scope tasks that can be completed individually. Each task includes a suggested git commit message.

## Phase 0: Baseline Metrics

Complete 

## Phase 1: Setup Basic Infrastructure

Complete 

## Phase 2: Centralize and Refactor Mock Infrastructure

Complete

## Phase 3: API Server and Client Setup

Complete

## Phase 4: Test Utilities

### Task 4.1: Create Test Utility Functions
- Create `test/utils.go`
- Implement `AssertInstanceEquals` helper

- **Commit message**: `feat: add test utility functions for common testing operations`

### Task 4.2: Add Job Request Helpers
- Implement job creation helper functions
- Add job assertion utilities
- **Expected effort**: ~30 lines of code
- **Commit message**: `feat: implement job request helper functions for tests`

### Task 4.3: Add Error Simulation Helpers
- Add utilities for simulating provider errors
- Implement failure scenario mocks
- **Expected effort**: ~50 lines of code
- **Commit message**: `feat: add error simulation helpers for testing failure scenarios`

## Phase 5: Example Tests

### Task 5.1: Create Basic Integration Test Example
- Create `test/example_test.go`
- Implement a simple successful job creation test
- Document usage patterns
- **Expected effort**: ~60 lines of code
- **Commit message**: `test: add basic integration test example for job creation`

### Task 5.2: Implement Instance Creation Test
- Add test for instance creation workflow
- Verify provider mocks are called correctly
- **Expected effort**: ~70 lines of code
- **Commit message**: `test: implement integration tests for instance creation workflow`

### Task 5.3: Add Error Handling Test Cases
- Implement tests for error conditions
- Verify error propagation through API layers
- **Expected effort**: ~60 lines of code
- **Commit message**: `test: add error handling test cases for API error scenarios`

### Task 5.4: Measure Post-Implementation Metrics
- Measure test coverage after implementing new integration test package
- Document metrics before existing tests are refactored
- Compare with baseline metrics from Phase 0
- **Expected effort**: ~20 lines of documentation
- **Commit message**: `docs: measure and document post-implementation test metrics`

## Phase 6: Refactoring and Integration

### Task 6.1: Refactor Existing Tests
- Identify tests that would benefit from the new approach
- Convert selected tests to use the integration test package
- **Expected effort**: Varies, but aim for < 100 lines per commit
- **Commit message**: `refactor: convert existing tests to use integration test package`
  - Note: This may be split into multiple commits, e.g.,
    - `refactor: convert API client tests to use integration test package`
    - `refactor: convert provider tests to use integration test package`

### Task 6.2: Documentation Updates
- Update main README with integration test info
- Add detailed documentation for the test package
- Document patterns and best practices
- **Expected effort**: ~60 lines of documentation
- **Commit message**: `docs: update documentation with integration test usage guidelines`

### Task 6.3: CI Integration
- Update CI pipeline to run integration tests
- Configure test timeouts appropriately
- **Expected effort**: ~20 lines of configuration
- **Commit message**: `ci: update CI pipeline to run integration tests`

### Task 6.4: Test Coverage Comparison and Success Metrics
- Measure final test coverage after all tasks are complete
- Compare three data points:
  1. Baseline coverage (Phase 0)
  2. Post-implementation coverage (Phase 5.4)
  3. Final coverage after refactoring (current)
- Calculate total lines of code:
  1. Count lines in mock implementations before the project
  2. Count lines in mock implementations after the project
- Evaluate against success criteria:
  1. Test coverage must increase compared to baseline
  2. Net negative in total lines of code (due to centralized mocks)
  3. Reduced duplication of mock code
  4. Increased API contract test coverage
- Create a final report with graphs and metrics
- **Expected effort**: ~50 lines of documentation
- **Commit message**: `docs: final metrics report comparing baseline, mid-project, and final test coverage`

## Implementation Order Recommendation

For the most efficient implementation, we recommend following this order:

1. Complete Task 0.1 (baseline metrics)
2. Complete all of Phase 1 (basic infrastructure)
3. Complete Task 2.1 and Task 2.2 (centralize existing mocks)
4. Complete Task 3.1 and Task 3.2 (server and client setup)
5. Implement Task 5.1 (basic test example) to validate the approach
6. Complete remaining tasks from Phase 2, 3, and 4 in parallel
7. Complete Phase 5 (examples and measurement)
8. Complete Phase 6 (refactoring and metrics)

This order ensures you can validate the approach early with a working example before implementing all the details.

- Task 2.2 depends on Task 2.1
- Task 2.3 depends on Task 2.1
- Task 2.4 depends on Task 2.2 and Task 2.3
- Task 3.1 depends on Task 1.3 and Task 2.4
- Task 3.2 depends on Task 3.1
- Task 5.1 depends on Tasks 1.3, 2.4, 3.2, and 4.1
- Task 5.4 depends on completion of Tasks 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3
- Phase 6 depends on completion of Phases 1-5
- Task 6.4 depends on Task 0.1, Task 5.4, and Tasks 6.1-6.3
