# Baseline Metrics Report

This document captures the baseline metrics for the Talis project before implementing the integration test package. These metrics will be used to measure the impact of the new testing approach.

## Test Coverage Metrics

### Package Coverage
| Package | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| internal/api/v1/client | 82.1% |
| internal/api/v1/handlers | 22.9% |
| internal/compute | 54.9% |
| Other packages | 0.0% |

### Areas with Low Coverage
1. API Handlers (22.9%)
   - Most endpoints lack comprehensive testing
   - Error scenarios not well covered

2. Compute Package (54.9%)
   - Provider implementations partially tested
   - Error handling scenarios need more coverage

3. Untested Packages
   - cmd/cli
   - internal/api/middleware
   - internal/api/v1/routes
   - internal/api/v1/services
   - internal/db
   - internal/types/infrastructure

## Code Metrics

### Mock Implementation Analysis
Total lines in mock files: 103 lines
- `internal/compute/do_mocks.go`: 103 lines

### Test Files Analysis
Total test files: 5
Total lines in test files: 2,336 lines
Breakdown:
- `internal/compute/digitalocean_test.go`: 750 lines
- `internal/api/v1/client/jobs_test.go`: 186 lines
- `internal/api/v1/client/job_instance_test.go`: 287 lines
- `internal/api/v1/client/client_test.go`: 659 lines
- `internal/api/v1/handlers/instance_test.go`: 454 lines

## Current Testing Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
1. API Client package has good test coverage (82.1%)
2. Digital Ocean provider has basic test coverage
3. Existing tests are well organized by component

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Mock Distribution**
   - Mocks are scattered across packages
   - No centralized mock management
   - Potential for duplication as new tests are added

2. **Coverage Gaps**
   - Many packages have 0% coverage
   - Critical components like services and repositories untested
   - API handlers have very low coverage (22.9%)

3. **Integration Testing**
   - No end-to-end API testing
   - Components tested in isolation
   - API contract changes not caught by current tests

## Success Criteria Baseline

This section establishes the baseline for measuring success of the integration test package implementation:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Overall weighted average: ~26.6%
   - API contract coverage: 0% (no integration tests)

2. **Code Metrics**
   - Mock implementation lines: 103
   - Test code lines: 2,336
   - Mock duplication: Currently centralized in one file

3. **Test Quality**
   - Number of test files: 5
   - Test execution time: ~1.17s
   - Known flaky tests: TBD (needs monitoring)

## Recommendations

Based on these metrics, the following areas should be prioritized:

1. **Critical Coverage Gaps**
   - Add tests for untested packages
   - Increase handler coverage
   - Add integration tests for API contract verification

2. **Mock Management**
   - Centralize mock implementations
   - Create reusable mock configurations
   - Reduce potential for duplication

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Implement test environment setup
   - Add utilities for common testing patterns
   - Create helpers for test data generation

This baseline will be used to measure the effectiveness of the integration test package implementation in subsequent phases.
